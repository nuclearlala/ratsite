<p> A probably ever growing list of some of my favorite characters, I guess people call these shrines but that makes it sound kinda weird? so I won't be doing that, This is just a Blorbo list !
  <font size="2">I guess I should state for people who aren't terminally online what "Blorbo" means so heres the basic urban dictionary definition "the term 'blorbo' refers to a person's favorite or beloved character from any piece of fandom media."</font>

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Sarah from show Sarah and Duck from BBC and Karrot Animation. She has been the longest blorbo I have and the one I'm (loosely) known for online. That One Guy who loves the girl from that Duck show.
            I've come to terms with that and fully accept it :P My interest in the show techincally started before 2017, I saw the show airing on Sprout, usually just from siblings watching it.
            They were all young so I'm sure its not something they actually remember lmao. Anyways I saw the show from that and was like, dang that has a really cute style and cozy vibes. The only thing is at the time I felt.. 
            IDK, embarrassed to like a show that was so below my targeted demographic? Well that far below I suppose, I watched a lotta cartoons and junk but something about a Preschooler show felt weird I guess?
            It took a year or and help from a friend to realize it's okay to like things basically.

            I have so many fond memories of this show, it's kinda crazy. I remember using VPNs to watch new episodes, or the hype of there BEING new episodes. Trying to follow a Toy Fair that was happening that was showing new toys and plushes of the show,
            The friends I made from it, It's how my Boyfriend found me online and tried reaching out to me! Just a Show and Character that mean more to me than some of my non-immedient family members.

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Vida the Vet from Spinmaster Entertainments' Vida The Vet. I randomly found this show on a NOT file sharing website and was like hey that looks kinda cute? maybe I'll try it!
              It took a while for me to actually watch it but I figured, what the hell I got nothing to do I'll try it out. At first I'll admit I wasn't too into it? I like it of course but It didn't hook me right away. I think it took a few watches to really sink its teeth in me.
              It's such a fun, cute little show and rides the line of Edutainment really well. I don't feel like I'm being preached to too hard about like simple things in life, obviously I know that's great for the target demographic but also at least when I was a kid if something
              was TOO educational it wasn't entertaining to me and I assume that's not an umcommon thing, specially nowadays. All that aside it's super cute, I love all the animal characters too- Like they all have traits or even disabilities that are such a good thing to have for 
              people to identify with. Zigzag is such a good rep for ADHD and I relate to her so hard, the same to Prickly and her anxiety it's just so good. Speaking of representation Vida having Two dads is so good to see aaa!
              It's just such a comfort show now and I'd be in a much worse place without it lately!! She might be a new blorbo, but she's been as impactful as Sarah has been!

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5"> The Silliest of bunnies!!! I used to be way WAY more into this show, akin to my obsession with Sarah and Duck but after a while- and It was a while I think my affinity for the show died a little bit?
            for a few minor reasons, I could list a few like how miserable the songs are, obviously I'm not gonna shame kids for singing poorly since they're just kids but It's a bit of a hinderance. The other thing is it rides the fine line from Entertainment to Education
          and it's a little bit more on the educational side to be as good as something like Sarah and Duck which isn't really something education it's more just general entertainment. All that being said though I still very much enjoy this show and this silly bunny! (and her friends too!)
          The show is still very cozy, very nice. Honestly I need to finish the series even, I never did that!

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Alice!! From various sources really, most things that have her I like an a lot of her various forms and such! This section specifically covers Disney's Alice, Disney's Alices Wonderland Bakery and American McGee's Alice!
            I only recently started getting into this character and franchise.. Well I guess this is techincally two franchises but you know what I mean! Funny enough my enjoyment started with seeing cute art of Pinocchio and American McGees Alice- That got me playing 
            the original Alice game, which then got me to watch the original Disney movie- which THEN got me to watch Alices Wonderland Bakery. I should note I usually do not like Disney related things, Quite the opposite to be honest, so this is something kinda new.
            I still keep that I do not support them or anything they do typically- I just think she's cute, and I like the whimsy that exists in the Disney world, and how then American McGee's version twists that. It's something so cool that I wish I saw more often.

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5"> This is an odd one, It's a show me and a friend stumbled upon. I'm not sure how they found it TBH, but it was literally at like 7am when they shared it and I was absolutely hyper focused on it
            for like, I dunno like 3 hours straight, making gifs and talking about how cute it was. It didn't have english Subtitles for a bit, since it's a show from uhhhh Kazakhstan I'm pretty sure. A really interesting find honestly, It's very cozy;
          granted most shows I like are very cozy, that's kinda why I like so many baby shows. They all are just cozy vibes. Of course baby shows aren't the only shows I use for comfort- but it's the main ones. Nonetheless I don't have much else to say here,
        Out of all the characters Sulu is my absolute favorite so this section is dedicated to her- though I do love all the charactrs in this show. Lala, Sulu, Tima heck! even their parents are super cute! It's just a very cute show. It's got big Bluey Vibes if that's somethin' you'd like.</font>

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">I originally had no interest in 'Object Shows' really, before I watched them my only knowledge of them was the original season of BFDI which I just could not watch.
            I'm sure for kids who grew up watching it, It's still a fun romp through memory lane- and on like a techincal level its crazy it was like maybe by just some kids! However by the time I learned about the show 
            It was a bit.. grating to watch/listen to? not that I'm some kinda snob over animation but the jokes never really landed, it was visually unappealing and the voice acting was ya know.. bad
            of course it was still A really cool feat for some kids to do, but It just wasn't for me. 
            However, My opinion changed after watching the (at the time) latest iteration of the show, BFB which was actually quite fun! Jokes still can miss pretty hard, but it's fun animation style 
            It's quick pace was fairly enjoyable, so even if something missed it didn't linger long. A lot of the characters have a nicer design to them as well- It just has a nice polish to to the originals didn't have and
            that's the reason I wasn't hooked. 
            ANYWAYS!! Remote!! I'm not sure why, but I really attached to her which is weird since I feel she's a character overlooked a bit? She doesn't have many scenes and doesn't have a lot of hype around her, shes just kinda
            there, which is fine! I think her simple robot-y character and tropes she has is really appealing to me and I cannot explain why, but the Text To Speech voice is so cute? I have no idea why I think it is, out of context
            it like isn't, but something about it. I guess its just I like personifying tech products, and giving her a robot-y voice is something that's super fun. Either way, I can't fully explain my attachment to characters I like sometimes. :P
