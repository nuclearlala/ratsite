<p> A probably ever growing list of some of my favorite characters, I guess people call these shrines but that makes it sound kinda weird? so I won't be doing that, This is just a Blorbo list !
  <font size="2">I guess I should state for people who aren't terminally online what "Blorbo" means so heres the basic urban dictionary definition "the term 'blorbo' refers to a person's favorite or beloved character from any piece of fandom media."</font>

              It took a while for me to actually watch it but I figured, what the hell I got nothing to do I'll try it out. At first I'll admit I wasn't too into it? I like it of course but It didn't hook me right away. I think it took a few watches to really sink its teeth in me.

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Sarah from show Sarah and Duck from BBC and Karrot Animation. She has been the longest blorbo I have and the one I'm (loosely) known for online. That One Guy who loves the girl from that Duck show.
            I've come to terms with that and fully accept it :P My interest in the show techincally started before 2017, I saw the show airing on Sprout, usually just from siblings watching it.
            They were all young so I'm sure its not something they actually remember lmao. Anyways I saw the show from that and was like, dang that has a really cute style and cozy vibes. The only thing is at the time I felt.. 
            IDK, embarrassed to like a show that was so below my targeted demographic? Well that far below I suppose, I watched a lotta cartoons and junk but something about a Preschooler show felt weird I guess?
            It took a year or and help from a friend to realize it's okay to like things basically.

            I have so many fond memories of this show, it's kinda crazy. I remember using VPNs to watch new episodes, or the hype of there BEING new episodes. Trying to follow a Toy Fair that was happening that was showing new toys and plushes of the show,
            The friends I made from it, It's how my Boyfriend found me online and tried reaching out to me! Just a Show and Character that mean more to me than some of my non-immedient family members.

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Alice!! From various sources really, most things that have her I like an a lot of her various forms and such! This section specifically covers Disney's Alice, Disney's Alices Wonderland Bakery and American McGee's Alice!
            I only recently started getting into this character and franchise.. Well I guess this is techincally two franchises but you know what I mean! Funny enough my enjoyment started with seeing cute art of Pinocchio and American McGees Alice- That got me playing 
            the original Alice game, which then got me to watch the original Disney movie- which THEN got me to watch Alices Wonderland Bakery. I should note I usually do not like Disney related things, Quite the opposite to be honest, so this is something kinda new.
            I still keep that I do not support them or anything they do typically- I just think she's cute, and I like the whimsy that exists in the Disney world, and how then American McGee's version twists that. It's something so cool that I wish I saw more often.

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5"> This is an odd one, It's a show me and a friend stumbled upon. I'm not sure how they found it TBH, but it was literally at like 7am when they shared it and I was absolutely hyper focused on it
            for like, I dunno like 3 hours straight, making gifs and talking about how cute it was. It didn't have english Subtitles for a bit, since it's a show from uhhhh Kazakhstan I'm pretty sure. A really interesting find honestly, It's very cozy;
          granted most shows I like are very cozy, that's kinda why I like so many baby shows. They all are just cozy vibes. Of course baby shows aren't the only shows I use for comfort- but it's the main ones. Nonetheless I don't have much else to say here,
        Out of all the characters Sulu is my absolute favorite so this section is dedicated to her- though I do love all the charactrs in this show. Lala, Sulu, Tima heck! even their parents are super cute! It's just a very cute show. It's got big Bluey Vibes if that's somethin' you'd like.</font>
