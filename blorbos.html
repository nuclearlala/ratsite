<p> A probably ever growing list of some of my favorite characters, I guess people call these shrines but that makes it sound kinda weird? so I won't be doing that, This is just a Blorbo list !</p>

        <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Vida the Vet from Spinmaster Entertainments' Vida The Vet. I randomly found this show on a NOT file sharing website and was like hey that looks kinda cute? maybe I'll try it!
            It took a while for me to actually watch it but I figured, what the hell I got nothing to do I'll try it out. At first I'll admit I wasn't too into it? I like it of course but It didn't hook me right away. I think it took a few watches to really sink its teeth in me.
