<p> A probably ever growing list of some of my favorite characters, I guess people call these shrines but that makes it sound kinda weird? so I won't be doing that, This is just a Blorbo list !</p>

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Vida the Vet from Spinmaster Entertainments' Vida The Vet. I randomly found this show on a NOT file sharing website and was like hey that looks kinda cute? maybe I'll try it!
              It took a while for me to actually watch it but I figured, what the hell I got nothing to do I'll try it out. At first I'll admit I wasn't too into it? I like it of course but It didn't hook me right away. I think it took a few watches to really sink its teeth in me.

          <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Sarah from show Sarah and Duck from BBC and Karrot Animation. She has been the longest blorbo I have and the one I'm (loosely) known for online. That One Guy who loves the girl from that Duck show.
            I've come to terms with that and fully accept it :P My interest in the show techincally started before 2017, I saw the show airing on PBS Sprout, usually just from siblings watching it.
            They were all young so I'm sure its not something they actually remember lmao. Anyways I saw the show from that and was like, dang that has a really cute style and cozy vibes. The only thing is at the time I felt.. 
            IDK, embarrassed to like a show that was so below my targeted demographic? Well that far below I suppose, I watched a lotta cartoons and junk but something about a Preschooler show felt weird I guess?
            It took a year or and help from a friend to realize it's okay to like things basically.

            I have so many fond memories of this show, it's kinda crazy. I remember using VPNs to watch new episodes, or the hype of there BEING new episodes. Trying to follow a Toy Fair that was happening that was showing new toys and plushes of the show,
            The friends I made from it, It's how my Boyfriend found me online and tried reaching out to me! Just a Show and Character that mean more to me than some of my non-immedient family members.
