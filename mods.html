  <p> Here is a compilation or list of mods I've made for various games, most of them are going to be for Nuclear Throne- A game I modded fairly regularly though had fallen off a bit slightly.
    There are a few for other games, like Spelunky and Webfishing- anyways any mod I've made will be listed here as well as a link to download it!

            <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="4">Sarah from  the show Sarah and Duck, but in Nuclear Throne. My first ever mod for a game that isn't just texture swaps! This is a fully playable
              Sarah in nuclear throne, with a functional active ability, passive, Ultras and everything in between! It may be my first but I still think it's my best. I've heard from various people 
              and saw on subreddits or discords people fairly enjoy this mod? which is pretty good- I don't think it's my most popular one, though I think it's the one I'm known for over all the others.

            <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="4"> Does an enderman need any kinda introduction? It's an Enderman! From Minecraft! He's always been a favorite of mine, he's just a cool ass dude!
              he's my favorite mob from Minecraft and I thought a character that can use the walls around you as a weapon was a fun idea, that and being able to teleport was really cool. Admittedly having 
              TWO actives is kinda usually not the norm for Nuclear Throne Characters but I figured It could still be fun, And It was! I think this is my most popular character mod? and mod in general tbh!

            <div class="item2"><img src="/assets/mods/godzilla.jpg"  style="width:500px"></div>
            <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="4">Godzilla, another one that probably doesn't need too much of an introduction but ya know him big boy!! Always been a Godzilla fan since I was a kid, my dad
              started my love for that character and franchise and It never died. I admit this might be my most ambitious character? With mechanics I wasn't exactly skilled in making so It works.. Okay? not perfectly though.
              his general mechanic is that medkits do NOT spawn, Godzilla cannot use medkits at all to heal- instead he heals from rads. Large rad chunks are a guaranteed heal, small rads have a chance to heal. He's also
              very slow, and very bulky health wise. The active ability also uses rads too. The Ultra Mutations also like had multiple forms? like if you pick Ultra A turns you into Burning Godzilla. If you pick Ultra B you turn
              into Shin Godzilla- BUT IF YOU GET BOTH ULTRAS you turn to BURNING SHIN! It's crazy I still dunno how I managed that one tbh.

            <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="4">This is one of the uh.. weirder ones but.. Baldi! From ya know, Baldi's Basics? That wildly viral game from how many years ago? I had a fixation on it years and years ago.
              I'm not sure why tbh, I mean it was kinda fun though- Unlike this mod tbh. I don't really like it? after making it I realized he's like.. not really fun? I don't think he makes for the most interactive gameplay. 
              This was a joint effort with a person from the NTT discord server, They did a good amount of the heavy lifting for the code and I did some light coding and all the assets. 
              I remember people calling me stupid and cringe for making this lmao, fuck those people though.

      <div class="item2"><img src="/assets/mods/synth.jpg"  style="width:500px"></div>
      <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="4"> The Synth is probably one of my favorites and ones I gotten a lot of feedback on from people and seems to be a fan favorite- I think at least It's hard to tell. I've seen it come up
        in discussions on reddit or the discord very rarely so that's something at least! It's a relatively simple mod too reusing Chickens old Active ability to slow down time but giving it a vaporwave-esque vibe to it which was the original
        concept- funnily enough the original art for the Synth looked VASTLY different which, I'll show you here- this design dates back to <b><i>2017!</i></b> <br>
