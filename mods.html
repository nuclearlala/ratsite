  <p> Here is a compilation or list of mods I've made for various games, most of them are going to be for Nuclear Throne- A game I modded fairly regularly though had fallen off a bit slightly.
    There are a few for other games, like Spelunky and Webfishing- anyways any mod I've made will be listed here as well as a link to download it!

            <div class="item3"> <center> <font size="5">Sarah from  the show Sarah and Duck, but in Nuclear Throne. My first ever mod for a game that isn't just texture swaps! This is a fully playable
              Sarah in nuclear throne, with a functional active ability, passive, Ultras and everything in between! It may be my first but I still think it's my best. I've heard from various people 
              and saw on subreddits or discords people fairly enjoy this mod? which is pretty good- I don't think it's my most popular one, though I think it's the one I'm known for over all the others.
