The past few days, well week- has been kinda odd.. and not exactly great. A lot of stress, anxiety and a few breakdowns here or there to be honest. I was even in the hospital for quite some time over chest pains I started getting while at work. I'm alright for the most part, just so no one is too worried- I'm still alive it seems.
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the whole hospital thing was.. really scary- obviously, lol and only added to my anxietys and stress. But something kinda neat happened the next day. I wen't out to get some new clothes, maybe stop at thrift stores to see what I can find, didn't expect much because It was later in the day and usually you don't like find anything good unless you go FIRST thing in the morning basically.
<br>
<br>
<b>So it goes with out saying I didn't really find anything..</b>
<br>
But after a second glance, I DID find something. I skimmed over the VHS section, mostly the clam shell ones. I've been looking for Alice in Wonderland on VHS for quite some time? It's been weirdly hard to find, i've been looking for like idk months now. Even on DVD I can't really find it at thrift stores so, ya know it be like that. 
<br>
Anywaaays, i dove into the VHS section, looking through like.. layers of VHS tapes. They had like 4 copies of Return of Jafar or whatever the probably shitty alladin sequel is called, so a tad defeated I sat on the furniture they sell there to relax- I was still kinda gettin' minor chest pains so I was relaxin' talking to my sister and literally as I was saying <font color= "red">I still can't find Alice-</font> and like quite literally before I finished my sentence, I looked back at the VHS tapes It was just there????
<br>
<br>
Like I looked over it, a few times and just didn't see it?? But suddenly it just appeared there it as just.. weird. I'm sure I just missed it but hey maybe it's the world throwing me a very, very small bone. It's the little things you gotta look forward to I suppose right? Anyways, check below for pictures and a nice little video :3
