I've finally watched some classic horror/slasher films recently- It's halloween after all! Halloween, does last ALL month right? surely it does :) nonetheless, I've been wanting to watch more of the classics that I missed in the past. I watched Halloween last night with some friends and It was really good! It's hard to express like
how I felt, but my boyfriend summarized it best it almost has a cozy vibe to it. Like it just feels like the Halloween season, ya know?
I dunno if that really makes any sense, tbh but it does to me :P

I have a tradition of watching a lot of spooky stuff around this time a year with friends and family, honestly a lot of it is like.. pretty trashy? like a series that Travel Channel aired in like fucking... idk early 2000s-2010s about the scariest halloween attractions. I'm sure half of them aren't even around anymore but when I was a kid i remember watching those on TV while playing around in Gmod horror maps, or making shitty comics in gmod man if I could find those old Gmod comics I made they were on a now long dead deviantart page, and no computer I have would have that shit anymore- nonetheless, I really love those shows and they just make me feel cozy. Same with a show called Most Terrifying Places in America, from around the same time- very dated and shows its early 2000s age but thats why I love it. 
I'm very nostalgia driven, if you can't tell LOL

Anyways, next on the chopping block for movies Im gonna watch Im goin for The Ring/Ringu- I'll probably watch the original Ringu then the remake The Ring some time after, who knows! Either way, Halloween was a pretty good, classic kinda movie a little upset I didnt watch it earlier tbh- I'm wondering If I should watch any of the sequels, I know they.. aren't too good? So im not sure lol we'll have to see. 

I plan to draw one or two more spooky things before the seasons out too, I dunno if anyone has literally ever even read these but if you do thank you :3
