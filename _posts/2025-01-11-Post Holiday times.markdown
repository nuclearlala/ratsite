I got some cute Sarah and Duck snowglobe and a keychain, very cute I love it. Keychain is nice on my keys i use at work a 'do it for her' kinda vibes. Olimar and Louie, my Beloved....
Oh uhh and also A Taco Bell gift card cuz well u kno, I am a shitty food enjoyer LOL. The Portable monitor and iPad are super cool, having another monitor is really nice, def beats using a TV as a second monitor lmao. <br>
Oh, there is the bootleg ass Remote BFDI plush, it's very scrunkly, I like her a lot!! Digimon Movie collection is so fucking cool, and I love it It's so cool Im so glad it got released. <br>
Marvel Vs. Capcom Collection was just kinda cool, I loved playing those games with my dad so It'll be fun to play with family. There was some other very minor things but this is the most of it, It was a nice holiday, I hope ya'lls was good too :3
