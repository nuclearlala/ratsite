BLEH
I've been miserably sick with a sinus infection for like two weeks, and the antibiotics they gave me gave me even worse side effects- this shit is awful!! 
I've been so drained and tired all the past week, and I have so much stuff to do- mostly school stuff but still guh I'm so exhausted. I'm sure if/when I explain to my prof they'll understand but still im so cooked rn its terrible.

I honestly dont have anything to really add just that shits been awful. I've been taking warm baths to help with my sinuses and playing <a href="/pikmin">Pikmin 251</a> on my steam deck. which honestly, has been really relaxing so that's pretty nice at least! When I feel well enough also playing some Marvel Rivals, kinda addicted- I love Rocket Raccoon hes a silly little guy.

I don't really have much to say tbh I just wanted to add something here honestly :3
