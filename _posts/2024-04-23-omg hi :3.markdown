Hello :D 
i've been wanting to do more and more on this site but I keep getting distracted with life stuff, commissions, or just depressionn tbh. a few pretty good things happened lately at least, self care stuff tbh basic things that I've been just.. not doing? cuz brain don't work sometimes- too much stuff has been goin on and stress has been WILDLY through the roof honestly, shits insane. I don't think it's gonna slow down or get much better anytime soon tbh but just gotta push through ya know? I know at the time no one is probably reading these- and thats fine tbh but I just hope things will get better soon for me, I'm stayin' strong but ya know how it be :p

I've been listening to a lot of Hot Mulligan and the lyrics, <font color= "blue"><b>Things Don't Get Better, Just Different</b></font> has really been ringing true lately.
