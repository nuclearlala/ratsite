Hey y'all, It's been a while since I updated here- I've been meaning to but I started working more and more and ya know it's physical labor so its been pretty tiresome, but hey at least it's money right? 

It's been a long few months, a lot of life changes most of them very large and a lot I'm struggling to cope with but I'm still trying to push forward, It's all ya can do ya know. A long term relationship ended, Classes and work starting all in a relatively short timeline has been rough unfortunately. It's why art has been kinda slow lately? I did the comic only because I was tired of there NOT being a new one, I don't have a schedule for them or anything but it felt like it was too long and I wasn't happy with the last one anyways so it bugged me.

On lighter news, it was my birthday yesterday. I got a lot of nice gift art I was really happy- maybe I should make a little section on my site for fan art and gift art, not that I get much but still it'd be fun. 

As for site updates, I have some stuff planned I might start working on soon. I want a cool place to post or cataloge my DVD collection- maybe even games? Not sure there are a lot of cool sites for that but idk I think having a section showing my favorite Movies, maybe with fun gifs and blerbs about em. I dunno, it's in the works!

thanks for reading if ya did <3
