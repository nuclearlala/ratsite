So a weird one here but I got this 1996 Sharp Zaurus ZR-5700 for.. free! Been having to help grandmother sell some tools from late grandfather, he had an insane amount of clutter that we're dealing with now but besides the point- This doodad was put out. I'm not even sure how much she would've charged for it, but since I'm ya know her grandson and set all her yard sale up she gave it to me! I absolutely do not have a use for it but its super cool!
