<p>:3 Welcome To the Rat Playground, or the Rat Hideout- they're both good names and I can't decide which this shit is !! This was a long time coming, I always wanted my own site to mess around on but
    never had the ability to.. Well I know basic HTML, but not nearly enough to make THIS website as its seen here. I owe so much thanks to My dear friend Lily <a href="https://buny.plus/"> <img src="/assets/images/bunyplus2.png"></a> please look at her website!!
    <center> <b>I'm not sure what else to put here for the time being, This will probably be an update log for major changes on the website or whatever!</b>
