            Hi! Thank you for visiting this Web Zone firstly! Wether you stumbled upon it browsing Neocities or from my other places on Tumblr or Twitter or whatever other hellsite
            I'm on (which is too many btw); I welcome you!<br><br> <img src="/assets/images/ratratratrat.png" style="max-width: 80%; max-height: 250px;" align="right">
        </h5>
        <p2 class="about">
                If you do happen to not know who I am and found this randomly- Not to imply I'm somebody you <i>should</i> know, I'm just like.. A Dude Online. As my Sidebar says<br><br> 
                My names <font color= "red">Lala</font>, It's what most people call me! I typically go by <font color= "red"> He/Him pronouns</font>! <br><br>

                I'm an <font color= "red">amuetur or freelance artist</font>, Mostly drawing cartoon characters from shows I love, or from Shows or Games- I'm mostly a Fan Artist I suppose!<br><br>
                While I do have original Content, It's not as common for me to do! tbh It's hard to have original characters when no one  really shows much interest in em :P of course isnt like.. <br><br>
                Important but it helps with motivation!<br>

                I stream sometimes, Not often- mostly <font color= "red">Saturdays with my friends at around 6 PM EST</font>? sometmes its later, but generally it'll be around then. lately It's just been Lethal Company because we've been like hopelessly obsessed with it LOL.<br><br>
                I used to speedrun <font color= "blue">Sonic Adventure</font>, specifically E-102 Gamma's Campaign- I still love my robot boy, even If I rarely ever do runs of the game anymore..<br><br>
            
                Outside of speedrunning I play a lot of games, It's a safe assumption if I'm playing a game, It's gonna be like.. TF2, Dead By Daylight, Lethal Company or like idk Pikmin? I play way too many pikmin hacks lmao. <br>
                I don't honestly play a lot of newer games- mostly because I'm a broke bitch LOL, But I have almost like 4000 hours in TF2 and I'm not gonna stop anytime soon. It's like a confort food game! <br><br>

                Other things if you'd like to know I'm a pretty big <font color= "red">Horror fan</font>, I love a good slasher flick, Scream, Halloween, Friday the 13th, all very good and classic films honestly, though <br>
                if you see my blorbos pages you know I love Ghostface the most. I honestly need to watch more movies, I'm workin on watching through the classics right now but it takes time, I dunno why I always strugging to sit through movies- but like
                a fuckin' 4 hour stream of a italian man looking at images of cryptids I watch like 4 times. Who knows. <br><br>

                Speaking of, If it isn't obvious by some of the thing on my blog, I have a deep fascination with anything spooky, paranormal or extra-terrestial- I'm sure if I was born earlier I'd be some person on like weird conspiracy X-Files ass geocities pages <br>
                I'm not gonna be like YES BIGFOOT IS REAL AND HE TRIED TO SUCK MY DICK but I think they're just.. fun to believe it? Like.. I know fuckin' Mothman isn't real but isn't it fun to think so? I guess It's just fun to beleive there are <br>
                newer things out there, things you haven't seen or seem to be unexplainable. <font color= "green">Ain't no way <i>aliens</i> aren't real though.</font> <br><br>

                I'm not sure what else to say here, maybe more will come to me later. Oh, uh I have a cat named Guppy.
