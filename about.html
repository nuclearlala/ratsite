            Hi! Thank you for visiting this Web Zone firstly! Wether you stumbled upon it browsing Neocities or from my other places on Tumblr or Twitter or whatever other hellsite
            I'm on (which is too many btw); I welcome you!<br><br>
        </h5>
        <p class="about">
                If you do happen to not know who I am and found this randomly- Not to imply I'm somebody you <i>should</i> know, I'm just like.. A Dude Online. As my Sidebar says<br><br>
                My names <font color= "red">Lala</font>, It's what most people call me! I typically go by <font color= "red"> He/Him pronouns</font>! <br><br>

                I'm an <font color= "red">amuetur or freelance artist</font>, Mostly drawing cartoon characters from shows I love, or from Shows or Games- I'm mostly a Fan Artist I suppose!<br><br>
                While I do have original Content, It's not as common for me to do! tbh It's hard to have original characters when no one  really shows much interest in em :P of course isnt like.. <br><br>
                Important but it helps with motivation!<br>

                I stream sometimes, Not often- mostly <font color= "red">Saturdays with my friends at around 6 PM EST</font>! lately It's just been Lethal Company because we've been like hopeleslly obsessed with it LOL.<br><br>
                I used to speedrun <font color= "blue">Sonic Adventure</font>, specifically E-102 Gamma's Campaign- I still love my robot boy, even If I rarely ever do runs of the game anymore..<br><br>
